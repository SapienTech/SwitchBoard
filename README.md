SMS in a Bottle lets you have anonymous text message pen-pals with anyone at Swat.

SMS in a Bottle will automatically pair you up with a random person in the campus group of your choosing. For example: sending the message "#tango How do I cross-step?" will forward your message and pair you up with a random tango-er. Once you're paired up, you can text as you would normally, without worrying about hashtags. Or begin a message with #swat, and your message will go to a random person on campus! When you're done, type #leave to end the connection. Once a few minutes pass without conversation, you will be automatically disconnected.

A few more things you can type:

	#busy will make you unavailable to anybody on the service for 12 hours
	#report will report your partner for abusive messages
	#unsubscribe will unsubscribe you from the service
