            SwitchBoard will automatically pair you up with a member in the campus group of your choice. 
            </br>
            </br>
            For example, you could message <span class = "example-text">"#tango how do I cross-step?"</span> to connect with a random tango-er. Or get some homework help with <span class = "example-text">"#math how do I integrate by parts?"</span>. Message a random Swattie: <span class = "example-text">"#swat sharples date?"</span> and stop having lonely dinners by yourself. You get the picture!
            </br></br>
            Once you're chatting, you can text normally (without hashtags).
            You'll automatically stay connected as long as you're still talking. When you're done, just type <span class = "example-text">#leave</span> to end the conversation. Or just start a message with a new hashtag to begin chatting with another Swattie!
            </br>
            </br>
            A few more things you can do:
            <ul>  
              <li>
              <span class = "example-text">#busy</span> will make you unavailable to anybody on the service for 12 hours
              </li>
              <li>
              <span class = "example-text">#report</span> will report your partner for abusive messages
              </li>
              <li>
              <span class = "example-text">#unsubscribe</span> will unsubscribe you from the service (we'll miss you)
              </li>
            </ul>
