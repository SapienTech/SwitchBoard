          SMS in a Bottle brings anonymous text message pen-pals to Swat.
          </br>
          </br>
          SMS in a Bottle will automatically pair you up with a random person in the campus group of your choosing. For example: sending the message "#tango How do I cross-step?" will forward your message and pair you up with a random tango-er. Once you're paired up, you can text as you would normally, without worrying about hashtags. Or begin a message with #swat, and your message will go to a random person on campus! When you're done, type #leave to end the connection. Once a few minutes pass without conversation, you will be automatically disconnected.
          </br>
          </br>
          A few more things you can type:
          </br>  
          </br>
          #busy will make you unavailable to anybody on the service for 12 hours
          #report will report your partner for abusive messages
          #unsubscribe will unsubscribe you from the service
