          <p>To start chatting, choose any group from the <a href = "/discover.html">featured boards</a> and
          text #groupname [your message]. You will be paired with an anonymous
          user from that group. Once the conversation has been initiated, 
          you can text normally without hashtags. If 15 minutes pass without 
          conversation, you and your partner will be disconnected automatically.<br></p>

          <p><b>REPORTING:</b> switchboard should be safe and fun for all users. 
          If you receive an inappropriate or abusive message from a user, 
          please text #report. Switchboard admin will be notified, and the
          reported user may be blocked from switchboard, according to admin 
          discretion. Please note that under this temporary reporting system,
          the reported message and both user phone numbers are made available
          to switchboard admin. A future reporting system may use an anonymous
          three-strikes policy. User <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B0TqrmH1J0Fsq4sPJPy7zC2IF0sOuPMEJ2EC9FTyE_4/edit?usp=sharing">
          feedback or suggestions</a> in this regard 
          are much appreciated.</p>

          <p><b>PRIVACY:</b> switchboard has strong concerns for user rights and 
          privacy. Please be aware, however, that while switchboard conversations
          are anonymous between users, switchboard is not a private chat platform.
          Because switchboard is in the beta-testing stage, information on user 
          phone numbers, conversation text, times, and locations is automatically
          recorded in the admin database. This information may be used for
          bug-tracking and reporting, only, and will not be otherwise used, shared, or sold 
          by switchboard.</p>
